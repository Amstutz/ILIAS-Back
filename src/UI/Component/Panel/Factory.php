     *       Tiddwell describes the Pattern of “Collapsible Panels in which one can
     *       “Put secondary or optional material into panels that can be opened and closed by the user”.
     *       They work well to acompany a “Center Stage” where content needs to take visual priority.
     *       Hiding noncritical pieces of content helps to simplify the interface.
     *       When a user hides a module that supports the main content, it simply collapses, giving its space back over to the main content (or to whitespace).
     *       This is an example of the principle of progressive disclosure — show hidden content “just in time,” when and where the user needs it.
     *       She futher recommends “Collapsible Panels” for: (a) Content that annotates, modifies, explains, or otherwise supports the content in the main part of the page.
     *       (b) Services that may not be important enough for any of them to be open by default.
     *       Their value may vary a lot from user to user. Some will really want to see a particular service, and others won’t care about it at all.
     *       Even for one user, a service may be useful sometimes, but not other times.
     *       When it’s not open, its space is better used by the page’s main content.
     *       (c) Users that may want to open more than one service at the same time.
     *
     * rules:
     *   usage:
     *      1: Block Panels MIGHT be used inside Heading Panels to structure nested content.
     *   interaction:
     *      1: Block Panel MIGHT be movable per Drag and Drop
     *   style:
     *      1: Block Panels MIGHT contain a cog to change settings of the content displayed inside the panel.

     *       Report Panels display user-generated data combining text in lists, tables and sometimes  charts.
     *       Bulletins always draws from two distinct sources: the structure / scaffolding of the Report Panels
     *       stems from user-generated content (i.e a question of a survey, a competence with levels) and is

     *   composition: >

     *       the text of the harvesting structure is given in full length with a headline,
     *       label of subitems, text of subitems in bulleted lists. This may be followed by a table
     *       comprising or aggregating the harvested input. This might be followed by a picture or a graph.
     *       They are composed of a heading panel which may contain several block panels. They might also cantain
     *       a card to display information requiring special information in their first block.
     *   effect: >
     *       Report Panels are predominantly used for displaying data. They may however comprise links or buttons.
